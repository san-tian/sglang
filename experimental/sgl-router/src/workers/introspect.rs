//! Single-shot `/server_info` introspection for newly-discovered workers.
//!
//! Combines what used to be two separate round-trips (the worker
//! manager's `served_model_name` fetch and `KvEventIndex::add_worker`'s
//! `fetch_event_config`) into one HTTP request. The result is dispatched
//! by the manager: registry consumes `served_model_name`, the optional
//! `KvEventIndex` consumes the resolved `EventConfig`.
//!
//! # Failure semantics
//!
//! `fetch` is **infallible** — any error (network, non-2xx, JSON parse,
//! invalid worker URL) is logged at `warn!` and returns an empty
//! `ServerInfo` so the caller can register the worker with empty
//! `model_ids` and no kv-events attachment. Workers that need accuracy
//! around publisher availability use `kv_events::discovery::fetch_event_config`
//! directly (it returns `Result<Option<EventConfig>>`); the manager
//! intentionally doesn't.
